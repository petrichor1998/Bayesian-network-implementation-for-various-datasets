Sample command To run the code:
python hw_4.py -train_data "small-10-datasets/nltcs.ts.data" -valid_data "small-10-datasets/nltcs.valid.data" -test_data "small-10-datasets/nltcs.test.data" -algorithm_number 4

algorithm_number = 1 (Independent Bayesian)

algorithm_number = 2 (Chow-Liu Tree algorithm)

algorithm_number = 3 (Mixture of trees using EM)

algorithm_number = 4 (Random Fores style approach for mixture of trees)
